Dear Prof. Colligon,

Thank you for reviewing our manuscript.

Prof. Sharipov suggested us to present the shear stress values in a table,
assuming that it is constant. Indeed, it is constant for the exact solution.
However, generally speaking, it cannot be constant for any general-purpose
relaxation method and, especially, for hybrid schemes based on the domain
decomposition method. The ad hoc methods for the Couette-flow problem,
similar to that we used to compute the benchmark solution, can account
for the constancy of the shear stress profile.

Certainly, the near-constant profile can always be averaged in order to
calculate the mean value, as it typically done for the DSMC method.
That is what we planned to do and wrote about this in the answer,
however, at the very last moment before submission, we decided to
replace unimpressive table values by illustrative Fig. 4.
First, we demonstrate the highly nonuniform microstructure of the
shear stress profile and supplement it with an additional discussion.
Second, we sincerely hope that we remove the issue of the necessity
for tabular data as outdated, since Fig. 4 shows the absolute error.
