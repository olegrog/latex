-- Discrete-velocity and lattice-Boltzmann methods is effectively coupled
-- Hermite expansion is a suitable solution approximation in the buffer layer
-- High-order and regularized lattice-Boltzmann models improve the hybrid solution
-- Deviation from the Navier--Stokes--Fourier norm can play role a breakdown criterion
