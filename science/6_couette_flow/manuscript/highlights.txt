-- The plane Couette-flow problem is solved accurately for the wide range of the Knudsen and Mach numbers
-- An extension of the projection discrete-velocity method for nonuniform velocity grid is presented
-- A nonlinear Hilbert-type asymptotic solution of the plane Couette-flow problem is constructed
-- Some unobvious effects in the profiles of the heat-flow vector and stress tensor are demonstrated
-- A comparison between the DSMC and projection-interpolation methods is performed
